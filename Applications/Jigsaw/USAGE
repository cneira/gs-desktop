You need a medium-sized TIFF/PNG/JPEG file to play this game.

Left-click and drag to move a piece or cluster.
Ctrl-left-click and drag to connect knobs to slots or slots to knobs.

Right-click to disassemble  a cluster, undoing the  steps taken during
assembly in as far as the structure has been preserved.

Ctrl-right-click to extract a piece from a cluster.  Shift-right-click
to extract a  connected component from a cluster  that contains pieces
not sharing a common boundary.

When joining pieces the second piece moves to the first. The direction
of the connector that  appears can be used to choose  the order of the
join.

It can be difficult to manipulate two pieces that are very close
together. It helps to move one of them so that they are at a greater
distance.
